# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning model developed to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model analyzes various features to determine the likelihood of ASD, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and intervention.


## Model
The model is implemented using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a powerful classification algorithm. The SVM model is trained on the dataset to learn the patterns and indicators of ASD.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following packages installed:
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
